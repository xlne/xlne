### Hi there! ğŸ‘‹

**xlne/xlne** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

This is my Github-page, currently with mostly school projects. Over time it will hopefully be stuffed with some more fun projects! 

Here are some info to get an idea about me:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as ... a .NET-developer.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... a lot!
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m very happy that I decided to change career to system developer.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me ... what you want to know.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: ... https://www.linkedin.com/in/linneanetzell/
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I have a 3D-printer to print personal, useful and unuseful things.

Stay safe and get in touch! :relaxed: :balloon:
